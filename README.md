**Get up to speed with building self-learning systems using R 3.x**

## What is this book about?
Reinforcement Learning is an exciting part of machine learning. It has uses in technology from autonomous cars to game playing, and creates algorithms that can adapt to environmental changes. This book helps to understand how to implement RL with R, and explores interesting practical examples, such as using tabular Q-learning to control robots.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand how to use MDP to manage complex scenarios
* Solve classic reinforcement learning problems such as the multi-armed bandit model
* Use dynamic programming for optimal policy searching
* Adopt Monte Carlo methods for prediction
* Apply TD learning to search for the best path
* Use tabular Q-learning to control robots
* Handle environments using the OpenAI library to simulate real-world applications
* Develop deep Q-learning algorithms to improve model performance

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
Xtrain <- MnistData$train$x
Ytrain <- MnistData$train$y
Xtest <- MnistData$test$x
Ytest <- MnistData$test$y
```
